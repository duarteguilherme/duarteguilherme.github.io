            <p> I hold a Ph.D. from the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania (2025). </p>
<p>
My primary research interests include causal inference and machine learning. I have developed general algorithms for partial identification and also investigated issues related to sensitivity analysis, transportability, factorial experiments, and causal inference automation. In the past, I have worked in journalism and data science. </p>
