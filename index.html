		<p>My name is Guilherme Duarte. I am a PhD candidate in the Operations, Information, and Decisions Department at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>
My primary research interests include causal inference and machine learning. I have developed general algorithms for partial identification and have also investigated issues related to sensitivity analysis, transportability, factorial experiments, and the automation of causal inference. In the past, I have worked in journalism and data science. </p>

<p> My work has received a Pulitzer Prize for Explanatory Reporting (2017), a Society for Political Methodology Best Poster Award (2023), a Society for Causal Inference Tom Ten Have Award (2024), and a Society for Political Methodology John T. Williams Dissertation Prize (2024). </p>
